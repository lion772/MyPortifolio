                                Maintenance of Java and Kotlin Code - I was
                                assigned to improve the java code which already
                                exists, and it compounds much of the whole app,
                                around 90%;

                            Here I had a great experience by learning how to
                            build single page applications with the latest
                            front-end frameworks. Starting with Vue.js, I
                            developed an application called &apos;image
                            board&apos;, where anyone can upload a picture in it
                            and save it on AWS and database. In the end, one of
                            the last projects of my course, I had to create a
                            social network webpage by using React.
