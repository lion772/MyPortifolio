                        Here I had a great experience by learning how to build
                        single page applications with the latest front-end
                        frameworks. Starting with Vue.js, I developed an
                        application called "image board", where anyone can
                        upload a picture in it and save it on AWS and database.
                        In the end, one of the last projects of my course, I had
                        to create a social network webpage by using React.
